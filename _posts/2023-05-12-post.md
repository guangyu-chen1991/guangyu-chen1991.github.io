# Learn about the Jupter Notebook

## Introduntion

**Notebook is a document which has two cells,one is _markdown cells_ ,the other is _code cells_**
**we can write our test in _markdown cells_ and write code in _code cells_ and we can alos run these codes to see a output**
**so it is convernient to use a notebook, there is [a whole book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) to introduce the notebook**
**if you want to learnn more about it, you can read the book**

## Mode
**There are two distinct modes in the Jupter Notebook**

**Edit mode:Allow us to edit a cell's content.**

**Command mode:Allow us to edit the notebook but can not edit a cell's content**

## code capbalities

**code cell is a cell which has an output.By using the cell code we can keep our results of code in the notebook and share them**

## Runing Jupter notebook

**The notebook can run in [Githun codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces),[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),**
**[paperspace gradient](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient/notebooks) and so on.We can also run a notebook from our local computer.**
